### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Computer vision enthusiast welcomes you here! ðŸ˜Ž I constantly try to improve my skills in fields eg. image and signal processing, deep learning and camera model.
Moreover, I also derive great satisfaction from sharing my knowledge and learning with Feynman technique, that is why you can find here some tutorials with theory explanation, as well as practical tasks. 

### List of repos with tutorials
- [Image-Processing](https://github.com/aflorkowska/Image-Processing)
- Computer-Vision - in progress, it will be available soon

Additional, there is a list of my recommendations:
- [pytorch-deep-learning](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/)

### List of repos to which I contribute
- [HistopathologyAugmentationResearch](https://github.com/Jarartur/HistopathologyAugmentationResearch) - also, check out [my repository XML-to-TIFF-converter](https://github.com/aflorkowska/XML-to-TIFF-converter), which is part of this project
