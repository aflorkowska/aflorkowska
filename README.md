### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Computer vision enthusiast welcomes you here! ðŸ˜Ž I constantly try to improve my skills in fields eg. image and signal processing, deep learning and camera model.
Moreover, I also derive great satisfaction from sharing my knowledge and learning with Feynman technique, that is why you can find here some tutorials with theory explanation, as well as practical tasks.
